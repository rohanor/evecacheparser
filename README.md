REQUIREMENTS
--

- Windows (XP or later).
- x86/x64 compatible processor.
- .NET Framework 4 or higher (possible support from Mono, although not tested)
- An EVE Online installation.

Notes:

- A full EVE installation is not required in every case. It is perfectly
  acceptable to have only the bulkdata and cache folders in the EVE root.

- On Windows, the location of the cache folder is automatically detected
  (in Local AppData, or EVE's root when EVE is normally run with /LUA:OFF).
